# telco-churn-prediction-and-bi-dashboard
Comprehensive churn analysis project combining exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and an interactive Power BI dashboard for telecom customer retention insights.


# 🔍 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end data science and business intelligence solution for analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry. It integrates exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning (including regression techniques), and interactive visualization to identify churn drivers and support data-driven customer retention strategies.

# 🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze customer behavior and churn patterns
2. Identify high-risk customer segments
3. Evaluate the impact of contract type, tenure, pricing, and services
4. Build predictive models for churn estimation
5. Quantify relationships between variables using regression techniques
6. Present actionable insights through an interactive BI dashboard

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Machine Learning & Regression (Scikit-learn)
3. Google Colab
4. Microsoft Power BI
5. Data Modeling (DAX)

# 📊 Dataset

Public telecom customer dataset containing demographic, service usage, contract, and billing information.

Key attributes include:

1. Customer tenure
2. Contract type
3. Internet services
4. Technical support availability
5. Monthly charges
6. Billing preferences
7. Churn status

# 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset was analyzed to uncover patterns in customer behavior and service usage. Key analyses included:

1. Churn distribution across contract types
2. Impact of service features on retention
3. Relationship between tenure and churn
4. Pricing sensitivity analysis
5. Segment-wise churn comparison

# 🤖 Machine Learning Component

A classification model was developed to predict customer churn based on behavioral and service-related features.

Key predictive drivers identified:

1. Contract type
2. Customer tenure
3. Monthly charges
4. Availability of technical support
5. Security and backup services

# 📈 Key Insights

1. Month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn risk
2. Customers with higher monthly charges churn more frequently
3. Lack of technical support and security services increases churn probability
4. New customers are significantly more likely to leave
5. Long-term contracts improve retention
6. Customers without dependents show higher churn tendencies

📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

An interactive dashboard was developed to provide business-ready insights, including:

1. Overall churn rate and customer distribution
2. Contract-based churn analysis
3. Service usage impact on churn
4. Pricing vs churn relationship
5. Tenure-based retention trends
6. Segment-level comparisons

# 💼 Business Value

The analysis demonstrates how data-driven insights can support:

1. Customer retention strategies
2. Pricing optimization
3. Service improvement initiatives
4. Risk identification of vulnerable customer segments
5. Evidence-based decision making
